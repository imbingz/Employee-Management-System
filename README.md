  ## Project Objective
  Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. The object is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

    * Add departments, roles, employees
    * View departments, roles, employees
    * Update employee roles
    * Update employee managers
    * View employees by manager
    * Delete departments, roles, and employees
    * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
